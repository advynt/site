>Human-folk gatherings are near impossible to resist. Their fleeting span of life provides them with an unshakeable love for joviality and any with a mind for reason tends to harbor a welcoming soul. The young souls of the Realm may be its future.

>The dwarves of Mount Rottluck are constantly mystified and rumored about, but during my visit with Murdok I found his life to be simple and immersed in beauty. They may be rude and tempered, but they are alike to the mountain. Jagged on the surface, with a hidden masterwork beneath.

>Bubbly as the dew which wakes with the dawn, Mirabell is a true talent. You'd be lucky to make her audience! Always the talk of the town yet scarce anywhere but the stage. I'm told she prefers her lonesome while she practices her craft. One must envy the willows she serenades at sunset.

>Feared not for her visage, but her word. Bets are never muddled, but if a champion is said to lose, it will be true. She has seen many champions fight for their life until they could no longer.

>It said it hailed from Ryn. Although it could not provide any further detail. When I spotted its towering, jagged silhouette over the hillcrest I feared one of the horde had strayed down from the mountains. I prayed to Voranthkel that my death and the death of my flock would bring us rest.

	As it lurched nearer my fear turned to morbidity and that to curiosity. I watched from across a pasture as it knelt into the grass, with a creaking grace, however absurd, it gently clasped it's needling claws around a rabbit. Without protest the snow white beastling was brought to its chest, and after a moment it went on.

	Since, it has watched the wood rabbits without halt. Its herd of bobbling rabbits has grown and prospered. And not another of my flock has been poached. On sunlit evenings I retire to the woodside and prod it with inquiry. I pray to find the words which bid it to return the conversation.

## Automata

Attribute Bonuses: +1 STR +1 CON

Health Points: 10

Movement: ~

Size: ~

Age: Automata do not conventionally age, but still accrue wear and tear. With upkeep, they may be effectively immortal.

Details: In sparing nooks of the Realm reside the most curious sentient creatures. Enchanted and Ensouled armored forms. The prized craft of eldre mages and affluent lords, the successful creation of a construct-automata requires vast knowledge and wealth. Even so, some roam the same as any vagabond, free of their masters.

Special Skills: 

Ensouled—The consciousness of the Automata is a part of its ensouled power source. This allows the mind and memory of the automata to persist separate from its form, if incredibly vulnerable without. An Automata is not considered dead until its Ensoulment is destroyed or faded.

Fabricative—Restoration magic is rendered ineffective on an Automata's form. However, its parts are able to be replaced and repaired with sufficient intellect and skill. Not all Automata possess the ability to repair themselves.

Resilient Design—Automata are afforded several Condition Immunities and Damage Immunities due to their unique physical form (Negotiated with the Game Master.)

Tireless—Automata are immune to the effects of exhaustion and don't possess a need for sustenance or even air. However, persistent or critical damage to the body risk Malfunctions. Malfunctions supplant levels of exhaustion, except the Game Master assigns a given exhaustion effect each time a Malfunction is gained. Seven or more Malfunctions attained, and the Automata form may be permanently destroyed.
